# School_District_Analysis

OVERVIEW:

A school board has commissioned you to revise a data-set of grades due to academic dishonesty, the incident happened in the 9th grade classes specifically. We'll be trying to get the full picture of the academic landscape by sorting the data by grade, school, and school type to get a better idea of funding for the next school year.

RESULTS:

-The district summary saw negligable changes after further investigation, with the average scores remaining basically unaffected(~.1% change).

SUMMARY:
Overall, the academic dishonesty in the 9th grade class at Thomas High had a relatively non-existant effect in the grand scheme of things. However, it's good that we made the change to show the data as accurate as possible to help the board decide on who gets funding, that one percent discrepancy could be the difference between a school or class getting less/more funding than it shouldve, which is exactly what we dont want. This revised data-set should help steer the school board in the right direction.
